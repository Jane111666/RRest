# Results Files

A description of the results files provided by the toolbox.

---

## Overview

The toolbox provides a table of results for the performance of algorithms in CSV format. This page provides definitions for the results variables.

## Variables

The results tables contain a header line (providing the results variables), and then a row for each algorithm. The variables reported are as follows:

| Variable | Definition |
|-|-|
alg_no | An arbitrary number allocated to the algorithm |
m_xa | The abbreviation of the filter-based technique used to extract a respiratory signal (if any). |
m_xb | The abbreviation of the feature-based technique used to extract a respiratory signal (if any). |
m_ef | The abbreviation of the frequency-domain technique used to estimate respiratory rate (if any). |
m_et | The abbreviation of the time-domain technique used to estimate respiratory rate (if any). |
m_fm | The abbreviation of the modulation-fusion technique used to estimate respiratory rate (if any). |
m_ft | The abbreviation of the temporal-fusion technique used to estimate respiratory rate (if any). |
alg_name | The algorithm name (using abbreviations) |
signal | The input signal |
two_sd | The precision of the algorithm (twice the standard deviation of the errors) |
bias | The bias of the algorithm (_i.e._ the mean error) |
cp1 | The proportion of RR estimates which have an error of <1bpm. |
cp2 | The proportion of RR estimates which have an error of <2bpm. |
icp5 | The proportion of RR estimates which have an error of >5bpm. |
cp2_entire | The proportion of windows for which the algorithm attempted to estimate RR, which had an error of <2bpm. |
cp5_entire | The proportion of windows for which the algorithm attempted to estimate RR, which had an error of <5bpm. |
cost_func | TBC |
tdi95 | The 95th percentile of absolute errors. |
percerr | The percentage error calculated as the mean absolute error divided by the mean reference RR |
mae | The mean absolute error |
sdae | The standard deviation of absolute errors |
rmse | The root-mean-square error |
prop_wins_ref_and_good_sqi | The proportion of windows which had a reference RR and high quality input signal. |
prop_wins_est | The proportion of windows for which the algorithm provided an RR estimate and for which there was a reference RR available. |
total_wins_all | The total number of windows used to calculate the results (_i.e._ for which an RR estimate was provided by the algorithm, and for which a reference RR was available) |
total_wins_in_dataset | The total number of windows in the dataset |
prop_wins_inc | The proportion of windows in the dataset which were included in the analysis. |

Notes:

- Only windows with a reference RR and with a high quality input signal are included in the analysis (unless otherwise stated).
