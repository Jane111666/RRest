# Impedance Signal Quality Index scripts

These scripts are provided to reproduce the analysis in the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**An impedance pneumography signal quality index: design, assessment and application to respiratory rate monitoring**](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/imp_sqi.html), [under review], 2020.

The scripts are provided in Matlab &reg; format.

## Summary of Publication

In this article we developed and assessed the performance of a signal quality index (SQI) for the impedance pneumography signal.
The SQI was developed using data from the <a href="listen_dataset.html">Listen dataset</a>, and assessed using data from the <a href="listen_dataset.html">Listen</a> and <a href="mimic_dataset.html">MIMIC</a> datasets.
The SQI was found to accurately classify segments of impedance pneumography signal as either high or low quality. Furthermore, when it was coupled with a high performance RR algorithm, highly accurate and precise RRs were estimated from those segments deemed to be high quality.
In this study performance was assessed in the critical care environment - further work is required to deteremine whether the SQI is suitable for use with wearable sensors.
Both the dataset and code used to perform this study are publicly available.

## Reproducing this Publication

The work relating to the MIMIC dataset in this publication can be reproduced as follows:

### Reproducing the analysis
These steps can be used to quickly reproduce the analysis using the curated and annotated dataset.

*   Download the curated and annotated dataset from [Zenodo]() using this [direct download link]().
*   Run the analysis using the *run_imp_sqi_mimic.m* script.

### Full reproduction
These steps include downloading the raw data files, extracting data from these files, collating the dataset, manually annotating the data, and performing the analysis.

*   Download data from the [Vortal dataset](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/vortal_dataset.html). You will need to download the data from young and elderly subjects at rest (the *vortal_young_elderly* dataset).
*   Use *run_vortal_downsampler.m* to downsample the ECG and PPG signals in the dataset. This will generate the *vortal_factors* dataset.
*   Copy the *vortal_factors* dataset to the root data folder, which is the folder specified by *up.paths.root_folder* in *setup_universal_params.m*.
*   Use Version 3 of the toolbox of algorithms. Ensure that all the required respiratory signals can be extracted by enabling the relevant settings in *setup_universal_params.m* .
*   Extract respiratory signals and calculate their qualities by calling the main script using the following command: *RRest('vortal_factors')* .
*   Run *run_vortal_determinants_analysis.m* to perform the statistical analysis described in the publication.

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as data to use with the algorithms, publications arising from the project, and details of how to contribute.
